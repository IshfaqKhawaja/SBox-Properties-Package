# SBox-Properties-Package
## This package can be used to calculate different SBox Properties like Non Linearity, Differential Uniformity, Differential Uniformity and Auto Correlation factor.


# Usage:
## Non Linearity:
## For an n*m SBox
To Calculate Non Linearity of SBox import non_linearity from package.
then call the function 
## non_linearity(SBox, n, m) returns non_linearity of SBox


Similarly for Differential Uniformity import differentialUniformity from package
then call the function
## differentialUniformity(Sbox, n, m) returns differential Uniformity of SBox


And to calculate Absolute Indicator import absolute_indicator from package:
then call the function
# absolute_indicator(Sbox, n, m) returns absolute Indicator of SBox
